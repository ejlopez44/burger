## Description

You can view the deployed application here at: [eat-burger-el.herokuapp.com](https://eat-burger-el.herokuapp.com/)

Despite this application's playful character, it was a full stack expression of all CRUD functionalities for an API including a homemade ORM.

The app allows the user to input a burger name to the database, displays the burger list on the page with the option to update its state to "devoured" which then reloads the page with the updated status. From there, you can choose to "clean up" (delete) the burger from the database entirely- all exercises in creating, reading, updating and deleting from a database.
